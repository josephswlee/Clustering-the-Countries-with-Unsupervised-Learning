### The Goal of the Analysis:
Categorize the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country

### About the Analysis:
Clustering is an "unsupervised learning" method, which does not have a target variable. K-means clustering creates K random centroids scattered throughout the data. Theses centroids act as the average represenation of the points that are assigned and this gives you a stroy almost right away. In this analysis, we will go over EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) process and creating K-means clustering model to achieve the goal.
